== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How can I customize the templates ?**

Plugin templates are loaded with the function bbptl_locate_template().
That function first checks if a template exists in your themes then load the default templates of the plugin.
So, if you want to have the plugin using your custom templates, just create a directory "bbpress-topic-location" under your current theme direction, 
copy the files from the bbpress-topic-location/theme in it, and edit those files.
Please be careful and don't remove hooks because this could break the plugin.

**How can I use functionnalities this plugin have elsewhere on my website ?**

See functions listed in the file bbptl-template-tags.php
